We'll be at the [Collaborations Workshop 2018](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw18/), run by the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/). Yo will be giving a lightning talk about the project, as well as a [mini-workshop](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw18/mini-workshops-and-demos-sessions) to start working on our manifesto.
